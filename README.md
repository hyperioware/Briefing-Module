Weather Briefing Module

This app was written for the 18th Weather Squadron. 3 days a week, they brief and discuss the dynamics within weather forecasts to sync everyone on the same page. Their prior iteration of this was a simple run-on web page with only HTML. This required a lot of scrolling, especially if they needed to go back in the frames to compare information. The biggest boost this gives is putting all of that into a slideshow format with clickable thumbnails. 

The other boost comes from the fact that not everyone knows HTML, so I wrote a database to save URLs and briefing meta so they could make as many as they needed without any knowledge of coding.
